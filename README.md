# Numberplate-Detection-using-openCV-and-easy-OCR

Vehicle Number Plate Detection using OpenCV & Tesseract OCR 🚗📸
This project is a Streamlit-based web app that detects vehicle number plates from uploaded images using OpenCV, Haarcascade, and Tesseract OCR. The app provides a simple and interactive UI where users can upload an image, detect number plates, extract text, and download the processed image.

Key Features:
✔ Upload Image – Supports JPG, JPEG, PNG formats
✔ Detect Number Plates – Uses OpenCV Haarcascade classifier
✔ Extract Text from Plates – Uses Tesseract OCR for recognition
✔ Display Detected Plates – Highlights the plates in the image
✔ Download Processed Image – Save the output image with detected plates

Technologies Used:
🔹 Python (OpenCV, NumPy, PIL, Tesseract OCR)
🔹 Streamlit (for UI and visualization)

How to Run the Project?
1️⃣ Install required dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow pytesseract streamlit
2️⃣ Run the app:
streamlit run app.py or python -m streamlit run app.py
3️⃣ Upload an image, and the app will detect and extract number plates.

🚀 Developed with ❤️ using OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and Streamlit.
